# a Calculator With React

This repo is based on a fork of <https://github.com/vasilykhromykh/React-Calculator-With-React-Hooks>, with slight changes on the coding style (in particular it implements styling using SASS)

unfortunately the live demo has been turned down...  
for the record, it used to be here: https://vasilykhromykh.github.io/React-Calculator-With-React-Hooks/
